<p>Someone that helps me reduce stress are my friends online and in person. Most of the time when I'm stressed, I usually play games online or talk about general topics about school or outside activities. I love playing TFPS games like Counter Strike and Valorant and have gotten decent at the games. I love all the games I play with my friends because they give me memories that I will definitely live to laugh by.</p>

<p>I am grateful for my family, friends, and the luxury of having a good school to travel to and having afterschool activities.</p>
<p>I want to continue to educate myself so that I can get into a decent college.</p>
<p>I Want to make it so that I can make others happy. I want to make my family happy (except my sister of course)</p>
<p>Other ways I like to handle stress is draw. I love watching funny shows people recommend to me</p>
