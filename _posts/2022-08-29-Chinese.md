This is a document to test my docx file for VSCode.

Chinese is my favorite subject for multiple reasons. For one, learning Chinese is really fun because it’s great to learn about another country’s culture and language. My parents are both Mandarin and I would like to know what they are saying too. My last name in chinese is 黄 as in 黄色的黄。
